                into issues when a particular product group needed to delay their release schedule.
                When the rest of the group began working on the next release in the main branch, the
                delayed group could not stay in the main branch because then "last-release" and
                "next-release" content would get mixed and there was no single point where the main
                branch represented the final release state. And so in these cases, we had to fork a
                release branch off the main branch and move the delayed product writers there. (And
                sometimes writers would keep working in the main branch out of inertia, and so the
                main branch content would get mixed up anyway...)</p>

                to be responsible for branch actions (forking feature branches and submitting pull
                requests), which they had never done before. Many products have multiple writers,
                which would require those feature branches to be synchronized on the server for
                collaboration. Some products have 40+ features in a release cycle, and our past
                experiences told us that writers could sometimes forget to switch branches. And so
                we decided not to use this workflow.</p>

                are finishing work in the release2 branch and moving to the release3 branch. Their
