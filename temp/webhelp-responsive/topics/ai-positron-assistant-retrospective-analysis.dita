            engine was released, and we are currently on version 4.0.0 of the add-on. Our main
            direction (which we still keep) was to provide powerful tools based on AI engines for
            technical documentation writers (targeted mostly towards DITA XML users) and for our
            XSLT/Schematron developers. I've always envisioned the AI set of tools as an
            exoskeleton, as a way to add more power to a technical documentation writer's punch
            throughout the day. The table below contains a list of concepts (mostly add-on specific
            features or feature categories), each with a short description based on personal
            experience.</p>

            Definitely yes. People might think they can just send the AI a bunch of content with a

            available translation actions have clear prompts that tell the AI engine to skip certain
            DITA XML tags like <xmlelement class="+ topic/keyword markup-d/markupname xml-d/xmlelement " xtrf="file:/D:/syncprojects/blog/topics/ai-positron-assistant-retrospective-analysis.dita" xtrc="xmlelement:1;117:44">codeblock</xmlelement> or

            existing DITA XML structure, including the parts of reusable content and key
            references.</section>

These actions give the AI more
            freedom to process existing content and create new topics on disk. The AI uses a
            feedback loop where it first proposes a plan of action, evaluates how the content could
            be changed, and then makes the necessary changes. These actions try to use the AI
            engine's potential to the max by letting it plan and execute more complex
            tasks.</section>

So, how can the
            AI engine help with this? For now, we have created two predefined actions. These actions
            use functions to let the AI engine access already reusable components. One action
            replaces product names with existing key references. The other action retrieves the
            closest reusable component to the currently selected paragraph. But I think more can be
            done in this area in the future.</section>
