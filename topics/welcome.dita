        <p>Our blog contains various useful articles and tutorials covering various aspects of
            editing, developing, and publishing using <ph keyref="oxygen"/> with various XML
            technologies. </p>
        <p>Sometimes (quite often actually) articles originally written for the blog are curated by
            our technical writers and end up being part of our official documentation: <xref
                href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/" format="html" scope="external"/>.
            However, the blog allows us to deploy various small articles faster, without the need to
            wait for documentation updates.</p>

            <title>History of the <ph keyref="oxygen"/> Blog</title>
            <p>The blog was originally hosted by Google Blogs and the first articles on the blog
                appeared around 2007. Since Google Blogs did not allow enough flexibility in
                creating the published content (for example, the inability to create a table of
                contents) the blog was migrated to DITA XML content stored on GitHub and is now
                hosted both on the <xref href="https://blog.oxygenxml.com/" format="html"
                    scope="external">Oxygen XML Web site</xref> and on the Netlify platform: <xref
                    href="https://oxygenxmlblog.netlify.com/" format="html" scope="external"/>.</p>

            <title>How the <ph keyref="oxygen"/> Blog Works</title>
            <p>The entire source code of the <ph keyref="oxygen"/> blog is stored in DITA content on
