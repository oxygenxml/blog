                    <p>Oxygen is a <b>DITA XML</b> desktop editing tool which can be used by
                        technical documentation writers to <b>write</b>, <b>reuse</b> and
                            <b>publish</b> DITA XML content to a variety of output formats like
                            <b>WebHelp Responsive</b> and <b>PDF</b>.</p>

                        is something like this:</p><p>
                        <ul id="ul_b5l_yxf_f1c">

                                <p>This one license would be for the person who besides writing is
                                    also in charge of customizing the published output.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>The <b>Oxygen XML Author</b> allows writers to visually edit

                                    expert, engineers for example) can use our Content Fusion

                                <p>And the pricing depending on the number of people who would

                <dt>What type of customer support and training will I get from the Oxygen team?</dt>

                        application. </p>
                    <p>For example if you want to create your own publishing customizations, these
                        are usually done using CSS. You would have one colleague on your side
                        creating the customization and asking us questions along the way. We do not
                        implement full customizations for you but we guide you along the way.</p>
                    <p>As for training, we have lots of videos and online resources for learning to
                        use Oxygen to produce technical documentation: <xref

                    <p>We can offer you a one-time web meeting to show you how Oxygen works in
                        general but if you want a more rigorous training we have partners like
                        Ryffine or Mekon who offer such courses:<xref
