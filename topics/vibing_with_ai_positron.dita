        <p>We initially started work on the <uicontrol>AI Positron</uicontrol> add-on for <ph
                keyref="oxygen"/> more than 2 years ago by creating useful AI actions to <b>improve
                readability</b> of content, <b>correct grammar</b>, <b>translate</b>,
                <b>proofread</b> and so on. Gradually we realised that even when invoking our
            careful made prompts wrapped as such AI actions you need flexibility to discuss with the
            AI further about results. So we added support to create custom AI actions specific for
            your needs. Such AI actions based on prompts tuned by our or your experts continue to be
            useful for precise use cases and for people who are just starting using AI tools.</p>
        <p>In time we also started to explore and enlarge the capabilities of using chat to converse
            with the AI, attach all sorts of file types (<filepath>PDF</filepath>,
                <filepath>Word</filepath>, <filepath>Markdown</filepath>, images) to <b>create
                documentation drafts</b>, <b>explore</b> and <b>make changes</b> in the current
            project.</p>
        <p>The chat view in any <b>AI Assistant</b> application like <uicontrol>AI
                Positron</uicontrol> is the new <uicontrol>console</uicontrol>, you use it to
                <b>direct</b> the AI, <b>affect changes</b>, <b>preview</b> them and refine until
            you have a working draft. You remain in control of a <b>powerful and imperfect</b> tool.
            As before in the past computers have moved writing and coding to a higher level of
            abstraction.</p>
        <section>
            <title>Vibe Authoring</title>
            <p>I would define the <b>Vibe Authoring</b> support in <b>AI Positron</b> add-on as a
                feature that allows you to:<ul id="ul_pjh_xvk_3hc">
                    <li>Define a <b>project context prompt</b> which gives the AI models general
                        information about your project, important style guide, terminology and
                        structure rules.</li>
                    <li><b>Chat</b> with the AI to <b>explore</b> the current project's contents or
                        to <b>affect changes</b> in the project. All changes done by the AI can be
                            <b>viewed</b> and <b>reverted</b> if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Connect <b>Model Context Protocol</b> servers to provide tools that
                        integrate <b>AI Positron</b> with other data sources in your company (for
                        example ticketing system, issues list, etc).</li>

            <title>Novice to Expert</title>
            <p>If one would attempt to divide people in novices and experts, they would soon figure
                out that each of us is a <b>novice</b> in certain fields and <b>expert</b> in
                others. </p>
            <p>As novices we use out of the box tools and frameworks with a minimum of customization
                to obtain poor results. We cannot explain either when the tool does not work or when
                it does. When we do not obtain quality content as novices we blame the tools.</p>
            <p>In time by <b>reading</b>, <b>writing</b> and <b>making mistakes</b> we evolve to
                understand the tools and frameworks we use. Taking some time to understand these
                tools and to customize them gives us better and more consistent results. </p>
            <p>This article is an attempt to give you a better understanding about how the <ph
                    keyref="oxygen"/>
                <uicontrol>AI Positron</uicontrol> add-on works and how it can be customized to
                maximize the quality of your vibe authoring interactions.</p>
            <p>I am not of the opinion we must consider using AI tools for all our daily work, our
                brains need the effort and work we put into <b>writing</b> in order to better
                understand the task at hand. There are still lots of activities which can be
                accomplished more quickly and with sufficient quality (generating drafts, improving
                content quality) by using in a controller manner AI tools.</p>

            <title>Set up Your Project Context Prompt</title>
            <p>LLM Models have a <b>limited context window</b> and start out as not knowing anything
                about the intricacies of your current documentation project. They can use tools to
                explore your project's structure but it's more efficient to create a <b>project
                    context prompt</b> which becomes part of each invoked AI action and chat
                conversation.</p>
            <p><xref href="customizing_ai_positron_for_your_dita_xml_project.dita"/>.</p>
            <p>The project context prompt contains an overview of your project's intention,
                structure, rules and style guide. It must be kept as short and informative as
                possible. In the <uicontrol>AI Positron Preferences</uicontrol> page one can specify
                the entire project context prompt either directly or referenced as a separate file
                which may reside in your project.</p>

            <p>The most recent <uicontrol>AI Positron</uicontrol> release added a new AI action
                named <uicontrol>Generate agent instructions</uicontrol> which can help you create
                the initial project context prompt content.</p>

            <title>Choose your LLM Model</title>
            <p>You need a quality LLM model to make quality changes. An LLM model which is both
                efficient, cost effective and with a high context window. From our extensive testing
                and experience we recommend in general <b>OpenAI GPT 4.1</b>, <b>Claude Sonet 4</b>
                or <b>Haiku 4.5</b> or <b>Gemini 2.5 Flash</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Context</b> is the key here, the LLM receives a project context prompt but it also
                needs to explore the project, read content and make changes. So your LLM
                implementation and platform through which you access it also needs to allow <b>tool
                    calling</b>. Most quality LLM models like the ones above also have <b>vision</b>
                support to read images and create for example documentation drafts based on
                screenshots or to generate alternate text for screenshots in the user's guide.</p>

            <title>Add Extra Tools with Model Context Protocol</title>
            <p>The <b>Model Context Protocol</b> Preferences page in <uicontrol>AI
                    Positron</uicontrol> allows you to connect to various MCP servers and allow the
                LLM to call tools implemented on remote or local servers.</p>
            <p>Sample configurations can be found in the <xref
                    href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-positron-desktop/ai/model_context_protocol_preferences.html"

            <p><b>Model Context Protocol</b> gives <b>AI Positron</b> the ability to provide for the
                LLM close integrations with the issue tracking system or the version control system,
                for example to allow the LLM to extract the summary and comments made on a GitHub
                issue and create a draft documentation topic from it. Example prompt:
                    <codeblock id="codeblock_jfn_vqg_2hc">Obtain description and comments from the DITA OT GitHub issue number 2021 and create a draft documentation 
topic using them</codeblock><fig id="fig_pl4_xsg_2hc">

            <p>Obtaining quality output and advice from the LLM, making accurate changes using it is
                all about the application giving the LLM enough context and allowing it to find
                extra context if the need arises.</p>
            <p>Starting with the use of quality LLMs, combined with a quality created and distilled
                project context prompt, then continuing with tools that give the LLM access to
                explore the project and make consistent changes, your short prompts and commands end
                up being properly interpreted and acted upon.</p>
