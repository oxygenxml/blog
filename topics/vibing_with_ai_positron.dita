        <p>We initially started work on the <uicontrol>AI Positron</uicontrol> add-on for <ph
                keyref="oxygen"/> more than 2 years ago by creating useful AI actions to <b>improve
                readability</b> of content, <b>correct grammar</b>, <b>translate</b>,
                <b>proofread</b>, and so on. Gradually, we realized that even when invoking our
            carefully made prompts wrapped as such AI actions, you need flexibility to further
            discuss the results with the AI. So we added support to create custom AI actions
            specific to your needs. Such AI actions, based on prompts tuned by your experts (or
            ours), continue to be useful for precise use cases and for people who are just starting
            to use AI tools.</p>
        <p>In time, we also started to explore and expand the capabilities of using chat to converse
            with the AI, attach all sorts of file types (<filepath>PDF</filepath>,
                <filepath>Word</filepath>, <filepath>Markdown</filepath>, images) to <b>create
                documentation drafts</b>, <b>explore</b>, and <b>make changes</b> in the current
            project.</p>
        <p>The chat view in any <b>AI Assistant</b> application like <uicontrol>AI
                Positron</uicontrol> is the new <uicontrol>console</uicontrol>; you use it to
                <b>direct</b> the AI, <b>affect changes</b>, <b>preview</b> them, and refine until
            you have a working draft. You remain in control of a <b>powerful and imperfect</b> tool.
            As before, in the past, computers have moved writing and coding to a higher level of
            abstraction.</p>

            <title>Vibe Authoring</title>
            <p>I would define the <b>Vibe Authoring</b> support in the <b>AI Positron</b> add-on as
                a feature that allows you to:<ul id="ul_pjh_xvk_3hc">
                    <li>Define a <b>project context prompt</b> that gives the AI models general
                        information about your project, important style guide, terminology, and
                        structure rules.</li>
                    <li><b>Chat</b> with the AI to <b>explore</b> the current project's contents or
                        to <b>affect changes</b> in the project. All changes made by the AI can be
                            <b>viewed</b> and <b>reverted</b>, if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Connect <b>Model Context Protocol</b> servers to provide tools that
                        integrate <b>AI Positron</b> with other data sources in your company (for
                        example, ticketing system, issues list, etc.).</li>

            <title>Novice to Expert</title>
            <p>If one were to attempt to divide people into novices and experts, they would soon
                figure out that each of us is a <b>novice</b> in certain fields and an <b>expert</b>
                in others. </p>
            <p>As novices, we use out-of-the-box tools and frameworks with a minimum of
                customization to obtain poor results. We cannot explain either when the tool does
                not work or when it does. When we do not obtain quality content as novices, we blame
                the tools.</p>
            <p>In time, by <b>reading</b>, <b>writing</b>, and <b>making mistakes</b>, we evolve to
                understand the tools and frameworks we use. Taking some time to understand these
                tools and to customize them gives us better and more consistent results. </p>
            <p>This article is an attempt to give you a better understanding of how the <ph
                    keyref="oxygen"/>
                <uicontrol>AI Positron</uicontrol> add-on works and how it can be customized to
                maximize the quality of your vibe authoring interactions.</p>
            <p>I am not of the opinion that we must consider using AI tools for all of our daily
                work; our brains need the effort and work we put into <b>writing</b> to better
                understand the task at hand. There are still many activities that can be
                accomplished more quickly and with sufficient quality (generating drafts, improving
                content quality) by using AI tools in a controlled manner.</p>

        <section id="section_ecx_l4y_dhc"><title>Use a Version Control System</title><p>Sometimes,
                you need to <b>view</b> and <b>revert changes</b> made by the <b>AI</b>, to keep a

                    <b>collaboratively</b> work with other <b>people</b> or with AI <b>agents</b>,
                create separate <b>branches</b> for working on features, keep your content

            <title>Set up Your Project Context Prompt</title>
            <p>LLM Models have a <b>limited context window</b> and start out not knowing anything
                about the intricacies of your current documentation project. They can use tools to
                explore your project's structure, but it's more efficient to create a <b>project
                    context prompt</b>, which becomes part of each invoked AI action and chat
                conversation.</p>
            <p><xref href="customizing_ai_positron_for_your_dita_xml_project.dita"/>.</p>
            <p>The project context prompt contains an overview of your project's intention,
                structure, rules, and style guide. It must be kept as short and informative as
                possible. In the <uicontrol>AI Positron Preferences</uicontrol> page, you can
                specify the entire project context prompt either directly or referenced as a
                separate file that may reside in your project.</p>

            <p>The most recent <uicontrol>AI Positron</uicontrol> release added a new AI action
                named <uicontrol>Generate agent instructions</uicontrol> that can help you create
                the initial project context prompt content.</p>

            <title>Choose your LLM Model</title>
            <p>You need a quality LLM model to make quality changes. An LLM model that is efficient,
                cost-effective, and has a high context window. From our extensive testing and
                experience, we generally recommend <b>Claude Sonet 4</b>, <b>Haiku 4.5</b>,
                    <b>OpenAI GPT 4.1</b> or <b>Gemini 2.5 Flash</b>.</p>
            <p><b>Context</b> is the key here. The LLM receives a project context prompt, but it
                also needs to explore the project, read content, and make changes. So your LLM
                implementation and the platform through which you access it also need to allow
                    <b>tool calling</b>. Most quality LLM models like the ones above also have
                    <b>vision</b> support to read images and create, for example, documentation
                drafts based on screenshots or to generate alternate text for screenshots in the
                user's guide.</p>

                        LLM about the base requirements of working in a DITA XML project and a
                        minimal style guide of rules. It has access to general tools to explore the
                        project and make changes, but also to DITA XML-specific tools to obtain the
                        structure of the DITA map opened in the <b>DITA Maps Manager</b> view,
                        resolve a content reference to the referenced content, or to find key
                        definitions that match a specific product name. For example, you can run
                        prompts like this in the chat view:<codeblock id="codeblock_dnm_rmg_2hc">Replace in the current file all product names with

            <p>The <b>Model Context Protocol</b> Preferences page in <uicontrol>AI

            <p>Obtaining quality output and advice from the LLM, and making accurate changes using
                it, is all about the application giving the LLM enough context and allowing it to
                find extra context if the need arises.</p>
            <p>Starting with the use of quality LLMs, combined with a well-created and distilled
                project context prompt, then continuing with tools that give the LLM access to
                explore the project and make consistent changes, your short prompts and commands end
                up being properly interpreted and acted upon.</p>
