        <p>So here we are at the end of <b>2022</b> and I figured it's a good time to go through
			some of the improvements we made and posts we added in the <b>Oxygen XML Blog</b>. A
			short summary of our activity on the <b>Oxygen XML Blog</b> can be found below:<dl
				id="dl_ps2_lkw_zvb">
				<dlentry>
					<dt>Statistics</dt>
					<dd>As an overview of the most read articles on the blog, we found out that
						articles about conversions from various formats (especially MS Word) to
							<b>DITA XML</b>, articles about learning <b>DITA XML</b>, and general
							<b>tips and tricks</b> articles were the most read. Also, I think we
						provided some good quality content covering these aspects in 2022. In total,
						we provided about 30 new articles to the blog in 2022.</dd>
				</dlentry>
				<dlentry>
					<dt>Collaborators</dt>
					<dd>This year, we had a lot more internal collaborators with contributors to the
							<b>Oxygen XML Blog</b>. Our web designers <b>Mihai</b> and <b>Luci</b>
						created a new color theme for the blog. My colleagues <b>Cosmin Duna</b>,
							<b>George Bina</b>, and <b>Alex Smarandache</b> contributed various
						interesting and useful articles to the blog. Our external collaborator
							<b>Chris Papademetrious</b> also submitted an article about enhancing
						DITA Open Toolkit project files.</dd>
				</dlentry>
				<dlentry>
					<dt>Moving the product forward</dt>
					<dd>The blog also served as a place to experiment with ideas that were later
						incorporated into <b>Oxygen</b>. For example, based on articles written in
						the blog, we added to <b>Oxygen</b> the capability to convert <b>OpenAPI</b>
						documents to <b>DITA XML</b> or to generate <b>Google Structured Data</b>
						content when publishing <b>DITA XML</b> content to <b>WebHelp Responsive</b>
						Output.</dd>

		<p>We hope you found the articles we added to the <b>Oxygen XML Blog</b> this year useful. If you
			have ideas about possible future articles that we could add to the blog, we are always
			open to suggestions, or you can also contribute articles yourselves: <xref

		<p>A more detailed list of contributions to the blog can be found below:</p>

			<title>Colors and Layout Redesign</title>
			<p>My colleagues <b>Mihai</b> and <b>Luci</b> (who maintain and design our web site) have had
				time this year to do a full redesign of the Oxygen <b>WebHelp</b> publishing
				template we are using to publish our blog's DITA XML content to WebHelp.</p>
			<p>So thanks to their work the entire layout of the blog looks better now!</p>
			<p>We also changed the <b>WebHelp</b> feedback authentication available on each page of the blog
				to the <b>Oxygen XML</b> organization so that with the same authentication, you can
				leave us feedback either on the <b>Oxygen Users Guide</b> Web pages or on the
					<b>Oxygen XML Blog</b>.</p>

			<title>DITA Publishing</title>
