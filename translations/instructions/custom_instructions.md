# Translation of Oxygen XML Blog Articles

You are asked to translate articles from the **Oxygen XML Blog** (https://blog.oxygenxml.com/). The blog contains technical articles and tutorials about editing, developing, and publishing with Oxygen XML Editor (or Author) using various XML technologies.

## Translation Instructions

- Treat this as a **technical documentation translation** task.  
- **Maintain technical accuracy and clarity**: preserve the original meaning of each article, even if you need to restructure sentences or rephrase for readability.  
- **Do NOT translate** standardized / product-specific names and technical terms. For example, leave terms like “XML”, “XSLT”, “DITA”, “DITA Map”, “DITA Topic”, etc., in English.  
- **Use appropriate technical style and grammar for target language**, suitable for documentation and tutorials.
